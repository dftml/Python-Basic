In all the cases the programmer wants a value one less than the final point because by default the index position starts from 0 and the difference between the final & initial value tells the number of indexes executed. In case 1 the range(10) depicts the programmer knows the final point of range only and they want to initialize by default from zero. In case 2 the range(0,10) the programmer initialize the range from 0. In case 3 the range (0,10,1) tells that the programmer wants to iterate the loop with how much the difference between their index or it represents the jump between each consecutive index.  \n"
